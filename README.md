# FOVE Unity Sample
This simple project demonstrates how to use the FOVE Unity plugin. It includes objects which react to gaze and objects which track to the user's gaze. (We do not recomment using the latter in released game, but seeing the example is likely worthwhile for many kinds of developers.)

## Requirements
* Unity 5.4.5f1 or newer (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive choose "Unity 5.x" tab)
* FOVE VR 0.12.1 or newer

## Running demo
* Plug in FOVE and start the runtime
* Start the Unity editor
* Clone/download this repo
* Choose 'Open' and select this repos directory.  This will load the assets but unity needs to know which scene to use so...
* Open the 'Assets' directory and double click the 'Sample Scene.unity' file
* Press play, under that choose the option to maximise on play
* Move now maximised Unity window to your HMD screen
